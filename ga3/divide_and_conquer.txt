Write pseudocode for a divide and conquer algorithm for the closest-to-zero problem that uses the
suffix-prefix identification problem as a subroutine, but doesn't specify which of the methods to use..

DivAndCon(int arr[], int n){
	int nHalf = n/2;
	int firstHalf, secondHalf
	int arr1, arr2
	int count = nHalf - 1;
	//suffix array, calculate sum for the first half of the array
	for i = nHalf to 0
		firstHalf[i] = arr[i]
		if(i == count)			
			arr1[i] = arr[count ]
		else
			arr1[i] = arr1[i] + arr[i+1]
	end
	//prefix array, calculate sum for the second half of the array
	count = 0
	for i = nHalf to n
		secondHalf[i] = arr[i]
		if( i == nHalf)
			arr2[i] = arr[i]
		else
			arr2[i] = arr2[i-1] + arr[i]
	end	
	call method1(arr1, arr2, size1, size2) or method2(arr1, arr2, size1, size2) or method3(arr1, arr2, size1, size2)	
}
