Times every number in the A2 by -1
Append the A2 to the end of the A1, making A3
Create A4 array the same length as the A3 array
Put 0s in the first half of A4 and 1s in the second
Sort the A3 such that every time a switch is made, the A4 is switched as well
For element 0 to n-1 of A4, i
	If i != i+1
		If abs( abs(A3[i]) – abs(A3[i+1]) ) 
			best = abs( abs(A3[i]) – abs(A3[i+1]) )
return best

Run Time O(n2)
