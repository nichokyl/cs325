METHOD 2:

SuffixPrefix(A[n], B[n])
Sort(A);
Sort(B);
min=65535
prev=65535
for i=0 to n-1
	for j=0 to n-1
      		sum=abs(A[i] + B[j])
         	if sum > prev	// The sum will now be going up because it they are sorted
            		break
		else
			if sum < min
				min=sum
				iFinal=i
				jFinal=j
return min

RECURRENCE:
The recurrence relation for this method, counting the divide and conquer aspect, is T(n) = T(n/2) + n^2.

Telescoping this out gives us:
T(n) = T(n/2) + n^2
	= T(n/4) + (n/2)^2 + n^2
	= T(n/8) + (n/4)^2 + (n/2)^2 + n^2
	= (n/2^k)^2 + ... + n^2

It is important to note that although it is asymptotically n^2, it will still be upperbound by n^2, as it will likely never reach that full size (it starts out with n being half the size)
